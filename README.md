Memoir of a PianoMan

I'm a musician, a husband, a father, a doctor, and a budding software developer. I was a chiropractor until a seriuos motorcycle accident terminated my career. I move into sales (please forgive me) as it paid the bills and took care of the family though it is not what I love or even enjoy (minus the sales engineering side).
