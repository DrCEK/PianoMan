Memoir of a PianoMan

I'm a musician, a husband, a father, a doctor, and a budding software developer. I was a chiropractor until a serious motorcycle accident terminated my career. I moved into software sales (please forgive me) as it paid the bills and took care of the family, though it is not what I love or even enjoy (minus the sales engineering side which I don't have the needed skills...yet).
